### 🛠️ Installation

Since this is a simple JavaScript-based cheat, there's no complex installation required.

1.  **Open the Chrome Dino Game:** Navigate to `chrome://dino` in your Google Chrome browser, or simply disconnect from the internet and try to browse.
2.  **Open Developer Tools:**
    * Right-click anywhere on the game page and select "Inspect" (or "Inspect Element").
    * Alternatively, press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (macOS).
3.  **Go to the Console Tab:** In the Developer Tools panel, click on the "Console" tab.

4.  Now put the Code
     - This is the Code
  
```js
// The URL of the script you want to load
const scriptUrl = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndresDev859674/DinoCheats/refs/heads/main/script.js';

// Fetch the script content
fetch(scriptUrl)
    .then(response => response.text()) // Get the response body as text
    .then(scriptContent => {
        // --- CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING ---
        // This will execute any JavaScript code found in 'scriptContent'.
        // Only use this if you fully trust the source of the script!
        eval(scriptContent);
        console.log("Script executed!");
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error("Error loading or executing script:", error);
    });
```
